		<p>With just two months to go until Cambodia’s commune elections, more than half of respondents to a new survey could not identify Election Day .</p>
		<p>The finding was detailed in a report released on Wednesday by the Committee for Free and Fair Elections in Cambodia <Comfrel> describing interviews with 2,690 registered voters from across all 25 provinces, including the municipality of Phnom Penh, between December and February.</p>

		<p>Hang Puthea, a spokesman for the National Election Committee (NEC), said he was “not worried at all” about the lack of awareness as they had just started spreading the word about voting this month.</p>
		<p>He said:</p>
		<p>“We are disseminating it via Facebook, website, TV, radio, leaflets, posters, mobile teams with loudspeakers, At least we still have two more months.”.</p>
